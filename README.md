Caststatus
======

An experiment in reverse engineering the Griffin PowerMate USB jog
wheel/button on Linux.

A read-only tool to show what's playing on local Chromecasts. Intended for use
with status bars.

You might imagine this having two modes, one for piping to a fifo, for
reading into a status bar or somethig, and another that simply outputs a new
status whenever there's a change.

This is the former.
